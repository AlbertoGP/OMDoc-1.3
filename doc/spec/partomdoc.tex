\part{The OMDoc Document Format}\label{part:specification}
  The {\omdoc} (\underline{O}pen \underline{M}athematical \underline{Doc}uments) format is
  a content markup scheme for (collections of) mathematical documents including articles,
  textbooks, interactive books, and courses.  {\omdoc} also serves as the content language
  for agent communication of mathematical services on a mathematical software bus.

  This part of the {\report} is the specification of version 1.3 of the {\omdoc} format,
  the final and mature release of {\omdoc} version 1. It defines the {\omdoc} language
  features and their meaning. The content of this part is normative for the {\omdoc}
  format; an {\omdoc} document is valid as an {\omdoc} document, iff it meets all the
  constraints imposed here. {\omdoc} applications will normally presuppose valid {\omdoc}
  documents and only exhibit the intended behavior on such.
