\part{OMDoc Applications, Tools, and Projects}\label{part:applications}
oIn this part we will address current applications, tools and projects using the
{\omdoc} format.  We will first discuss the possibilities and tools of processing
documents in the {\omdoc} format via style sheets with the purpose of generating
documents specialized for consumption by other mathematical software systems, and
by humans. Then we will present three projects descriptions that use {\omdoc} at
the core.
