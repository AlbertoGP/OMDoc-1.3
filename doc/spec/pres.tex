\begin{tchapter}[id=pres,short=Notation and Presentation]{Notation and Presentation (Module {\PRESmodule{spec}})}
  The main difference of {\omdocv{1.3}} is that it uses the notation system developed
  in~\cite{cmueller:thesis:10,KMR:NoLMD08}. This system is already supported by the JOMDoc
  system~\cite{JOMDoc:on}.
