\begin{tchapter}[id=mobj-rnc]{The RelaxNG Schemata for Mathematical Objects}

For completeness we reprint the {\relaxng} schemata for the external formats
{\omdoc} makes use of.
\begin{tsection}[id=rnc:openmath]{The RelaxNG Schema for OpenMath}
  For completeness we reprint the {\relaxng} schema for {\openmath}, the original
  can be found in the {\openmath}2 standard~\cite{BusCapCar:2oms04}.
  \lstinputlisting[language=RNC,nolol,
  index={OMS,OMV,OMI,OMB,OMSTR,OMF,OMA,OMBIND,OMBVAR,OME,OMATTR,OMATP,OMOBJ}]
  {../../schema/rnc/openmath2.rnc}
\end{tsection}

\begin{tsection}[id=rnc:mathml]{The RelaxNG Schema for MathML}
  For completeness, we reprint the {\relaxng} schema for {\mathml}. It comes in three
  parts, the schema driver, and the parts for content- and presentation {\mathml} which we
  will present in the next two subsections.
