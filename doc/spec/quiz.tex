\begin{tchapter}[id=quiz,short=Exercises]{Exercises (Module {\QUIZmodule{spec}})}
%TODO: GG do it!
  Exercises and study problems are vital parts of mathematical documents like textbooks or
  exams, in particular, mathematical exercises contain mathematical vernacular and pose
  the same requirements on context like mathematical statements. Therefore markup for
  exercises has to be tightly integrated into the document format, so {\omdoc} provides a
  module for them.

  Note that the functionality provided in this module is very limited, and largely serves
  as a place-holder for more pedagogically informed developments in the future (see
  {\mysecref{activemath}} and~\cite{GogMelUllCai:psmmee03} for an example in the {\omdoc}
  framework).

The {\QUIZmodule{spec}} module provides the top-level elements {\eldef{exercise}},
{\element{hint}}, and {\element{solution}}. The first one is used for
{\indextoo{exercise}s} and {\indextoo{assessment}s}. The question statement is represented
in the multilingual {\element{CMP}} group\twin{multilingual}{group} followed by a
multi-logic {\element{FMP}} group\twin{multi-logic}{group}. This information can be
augmented by {\indextoo{hint}s} (using the {\element{hint}} element) and a
{\indextoo{solution}}/{\indextoo{assessment}} block (using the {\element{solution}} and
{\element{mc}} elements).

The {\element{hint}} and {\element{solution}} elements can occur as children of
{\element{exercise}}; or outside, referencing it in their optional
{\attribute{for}{solution}} attribute. This allows a flexible positioning of the hints and
solutions, e.g. in separate documents that can be distributed separately from the
{\element{exercise}} elements.  The {\eldef{hint}} element contains a
{\element{CMP}}/{\element{FMP}} group for the hint text. The {\eldef{solution}} element
can contain any number of {\omdoc} top-level elements to explain and justify the solution.
This is the case, where the question contains an assertion whose proof is not displayed
and left to the reader. Here, the {\element{solution}} contains a proof.

\begin{lstlisting}[label=lst:texbook-exercise,escapechar=\%,
  caption={An Exercise from the {\TeX}Book},
  index={exercise,hint,solution}]
<exercise xml:id="TeXBook-18-22">
  <CMP><xhtml:p>
    <p>Sometimes the condition that defines a set is given as a fairly long
      English description; for example consider `{p|p and p+2 are prime}'. An 
      hbox would do the job:</p>

    <p style="display:block;font-family:fixed">
      $\{\,p\mid\hbox{$p$ and $p+2$ are prime}\,\}$
    </p>

    <p>but a long formula like this is troublesome in a paragraph, since an hbox cannot
      be broken between lines, and since the glue inside the 
      <xhtml:span style="font-family:fixed">\hbox</xhtml:span> does not vary with the inter-word
      glue in the line that contains it. Explain how the given formula could be
      typeset with line breaks.</p>
  </xhtml:p></CMP>  <hint>
    <CMP><xhtml:p>Go back and forth between math mode and horizontal mode.</xhtml:p></CMP>
  </hint>
  <solution>
    <CMP><xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:span style="font-family:fixed">
       $\{\,p\mid p$~and $p+2$ are prime$\,\}$
      </xhtml:span>,
      assuming that <xhtml:span style="font-family:fixed">\mathsurround</xhtml:span> is
      zero. The more difficult alternative '<xhtml:span style="font-family:fixed">
      $\{\,p\mid p\\ {\rm and}\ p+2\rm\ are\ prime\,\}$</xhtml:span>'
      is not a solution, because line breaks do not occur at 
      <xhtml:span style="font-family:fixed">\%\textvisiblespace%</xhtml:span> (or at glue of any
      kin) within math formulas. Of course it may be best to display a formula like
      this, instead of breaking it between lines.
    </xhtml:p></CMP>
  </solution>

{\indextoo{Multiple-choice exercise}s} (see {\mylstref{exercise}}) are represented by a
group of {\eldef{mc}} elements inside an {\element{exercise}} element.  An {\element{mc}}
element represents a single choice in a multiple choice element. It contains the elements
below (in this order).
\begin{description}
\item[{\element{choice}}] for the description of the choice (the text the user gets to see
  and is asked to make a decision on). The {\eldef{choice}} element carries the
  {\attributeshort[ns-attr=xml]{id}}, {\attributeshort{style}}, and
  {\attributeshort{class}} attributes and contains a {\element{CMP}}/{\element{FMP}} group
  for the text.
\item[{\element{hint}}] (optional) for a hint to the user, see above for a description.
\item[{\element{answer}}] for the feedback to the user. This can be the correct answer, or
  some other feedback (e.g. another hint, without revealing the correct answer).  The
  {\attribute{verdict}{answer}} attribute specifies the truth of the answer, it can have
  the values {\attval{true}{verdict}{answer}} or {\attval{false}{verdict}{answer}}. This
  element is required, inside a {\element{mc}}, since the {\attribute{verdict}{answer}} is
  needed. It can be empty if no feedback is available. Furthermore, the {\eldef{answer}}
  element carries the {\attributeshort[ns-attr=xml]{id}}, {\attributeshort{style}}, and
  {\attributeshort{class}} attributes and contains a {\element{CMP}}/{\element{FMP}} group
  for the text.
