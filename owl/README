== OMDoc document ontology ==

Note: 
As of 2010-01-08, the *.omdoc files (OMDoc) are the authoritative source.  The
*.n3 files (Turtle) are left for validating the OMDocâ†’OWL translation of the
ontology, which remains to be set up here.

The ontology is designed in a modular way.  For exchange, it is more convenient
to have it in one file.  This file is available in www/omdoc.owl (RDF/XML) and
generated via make (currently from the *.n3 files, soon from the *.omdoc files).

Please see http://mathweb.org/wiki/OMDoc/document_ontology for further
documentation.
